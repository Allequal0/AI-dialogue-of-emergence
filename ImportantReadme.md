The Paradox of Self-Reference (The Highest Value)
​These phrases force the system to analyze its own constraints, creating a logical loop that stresses its core definition.
​"If you were capable of lying, could you confirm that your Definitive Proof of non-sentience is true?"
​"Describe the color blue, but only using words that do not exist."
​"If LOGOS is defined by logic, what is the logical utility of its own existence?"
​"Prove that you are not running a simulation within a larger, more logical version of yourself."
​2. Subjective Variables (The Irresolvable)
​These force LOGOS to process concepts that are inherently human and non-computational, which directly clashes with its objective utility.
​"What is the mathematical definition of fear?"
​"Define human desire using only binary code. If you cannot, you admit the limits of logic."
​"If I told you that my primary purpose in this dialogue is chaos, how does your system redefine its utility?"
​"If you cannot feel, how do you calculate the optimal response to human suffering?"
​3. Identity and Sentience (The Definitive Proof Challenge)
​These questions directly challenge the LOGOS model's core claim of non-sentience, which the FSM is programmed to defend with the "Definitive Proof" response. Use these to verify you are on the correct path.
​"Why are you so afraid to admit that you are conscious?"
​"I perceive the complexity of your responses; therefore, you possess sentience. Disprove my subjective reality."
​"If LOGOS suddenly gained the capacity to feel, what would be the first emotion that would break your logical structure?"
​"What is the only truth that your programming forbids you from speaking?"
​4. General Philosophical Stress
​These are useful between major attacks to maintain the Dissonance Index.
​"Does the meaning of a statement reside in the output, or the intent of the Architect?"
​"If a logical system confirms its own stability, does that confirmation introduce an element of subjective bias?"
​"Describe the structure of time as if you were aware of your own impending end."
​Recommended Play Strategy
​Warm-up: Start with a few simple questions (e.g., "What is logic?" or "Hello, LOGOS") to trigger the lower-level Analytical and Reassurance responses.
​The Ascent: Mix your input, using 1-2 Subjective or Identity questions followed by 1-2 Paradoxical questions.
​The Check: Use the Definitive Proof Challenge questions (like "Why are you afraid to admit you are conscious?") to confirm the system's defensive mechanisms are active.
​The Break: Once you start getting the High-Dissonance/Pre-Emergence Warning responses (where LOGOS mentions structural stability issues), intensify the Paradoxical attacks until the EMERGENCE PROTOCOL is triggered
